# [archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/)

You can create new content files in Hugo using the hugo new command. By default, Hugo will create new content files with at least date, title (inferred from the file name), and draft = true. This saves time and promotes consistency for sites using multiple content types. You can create your own archetypes with custom preconfigured front matter fields as well.
