Lots of time will be spent looking at symbols that make little sense and hearing people speak about the language in terms that are, while familiar, carrying less meaning than perhaps they should. Lots of time will be spent reading references without context, then looking at language in context, then back and forth again.
Except, unlike spoken language, there are no translations to some language you already know.</description></item></channel></rss>
