Why are we doing this? What are the critical behaviors?
Principles describe more how you play the game than the game itself. They represent the ideal way to act and be in a particular arena (a project team, a company, a family) or in life in general.
Good to revisit periodically for quality control.
Examples I freely and spontaneously take the time to enjoy the simple and profound pleasures of life.</description></item></channel></rss>
