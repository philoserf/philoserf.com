The collection of all teams’ integration environments become, together, the notional “Integration Environment”.
A team’s integration environment may be constructed from the servers and services the team provides, and of the integration environments provided by other teams following the dependency model of each service. Ultimately, the full capabilities of our platform combine in the test agents that represent our external customers.</description></item></channel></rss>
