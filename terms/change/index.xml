Each identity has a shifting foundation.
What was liberal, isn&amp;rsquo;t. What was conservative, isn&amp;rsquo;t. Want was Democrat is now Republican and what was once Republican is now Democratic. What is at this moment will be different tomorrow while carrying the same name. Even our understanding of the meaning of a thing is infirm.
So grab the name you want today and use it. Wear it out.</description></item></channel></rss>
