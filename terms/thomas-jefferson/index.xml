never put off to tomorrow what you can do to-day. never trouble another with what you can do yourself never spend your money before you have it never buy a thing you do not want, because it is cheap, it will be dear to you. take care of your cents: Dollars will take care of themselves! pride costs us more than hunger, thirst and cold. we never repent of having eaten too little.</description></item></channel></rss>
