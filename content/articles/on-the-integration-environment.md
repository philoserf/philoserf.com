An integration environment is what a team provides to others so that others can integrate with the services provided by that team. The collection of all teams’ integration environments become, together, the notional “Integration Environment”.

A team’s integration environment may be constructed from the servers and services the team provides, and of the integration environments provided by other teams following the dependency model of each service. Ultimately, the full capabilities of our platform combine in the test agents that represent our external customers. For example; a Selenium script representing a customer using Internet Explorer at <https://shop.example.com/>, or a human tester validating user experience of a mobile application designed for iOS.

Integration environments are expected to be stable and production-like, available to development and quality assurance teams, and to our business partners as they work on the day-to-day activities involved with building a future experience for our customers.
