```plain
The clouds make a new terrain
And the mind seeks to map this new terrain
To the imagined real terrain below

Then

Clouds break
And the mind maps
The snow and the cloud
Getting wrong the depth
Mistaking one for the other
And the other for the one

All shifting imagination
At these thirty five thousand feet
```
