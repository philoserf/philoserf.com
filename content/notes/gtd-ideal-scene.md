A detailed description of a desired future. Ideal scenes can take on many forms – mocked-up articles in the press describing how extraordinarily successful your enterprise has been, collages with pictures and headlines that express what your life may look and feel like if you could have it like you want it, etc. It can simply be descriptive paragraphs written in an affirmational style. Wonderful to create and re-read and re-imagine on some regular basis.

### Examples

- We love the dream house we have completed and are living in comfortably now. It is full of sunlight at all times of the day, and gives us elegant windows into the night sky and air when we want them. We have all the room we need for storage and all the best equipment for gracious living. There’s a fabulous exercise and recreation room, inspiring us to work out and relax regularly. Our media room provides the state of the art entertainment and educational programming, and we are sufficiently wired and wireless throughout the house for optimal access to the Web and our own content. (Etc.)

- Our team has won big in the national quality competition, scoring almost perfectly in every criterion. We’ve had a wonderful time in the process, learning many things individually and as a group, and deepening our friendships. We are being held up as a standard throughout the company as a model of the new culture we’re moving toward, and we’re getting lots of opportunities to mentor others as we all progress rapidly in our own careers. (Etc.)
