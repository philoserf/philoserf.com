23. I attend a weekly productivity group centered around the GTD methods.
24. For the first 6 months of implementing my GTD system, and often thereafter as needed, I keep a GTD journal in which I write a “how’d I do?” update nightly.

### Intermediate

1. I have been using the GTD system consistently for 3-6 months.
2. I have read Getting Things Done twice or more.

5. I consistently follow up on “loaned out stuff” and “stuff I’m borrowing.”
6. I consistently clear out my email inbox to 0 every day by 5pm.
7. I consistently clear out my physical inbox to empty every day by 5pm.
8. I consistently clear out my voice mail every day by 5pm.
9. I consistently clear out my computer folder marked “inbox” daily by 5pm.

12. I have no unsorted papers anywhere besides my physical inbox, project files, and reference files.
13. I have a file cleanout day scheduled in my tickler file or calendar for once or twice a year.

19. I have found online and/or paper tools that work best for me and my GTD system which I use every day.
20. When clearing my inboxes, I start at the top and take each item one at a time until it is processed (instead of skipping around to what’s easiest).
21. I am familiar with mind mapping, and either use software or paper to do mind maps when useful.
22. I know the 5 steps of the Natural Planning Model by heart (p. 56), and use it for personal project planning and for facilitating meetings.
23. I know the Threefold Model for Evaluating Daily Work by heart (p. 196), and refer to it often during the course of the day, or do so intuitively.
24. I know the Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment by heart (p. 192), and actually work that way, or I have found something that works even better.
