Hunches about where things are going and optimal approaches to it.

Intuitive insights are seldom recognized when we have them. It’s useful to notice when an awareness may be present in you and feed it back to yourself at a future time. It can sensitize and enhance your perceptive abilities.

### Examples

- By the end of the year, I sense I will have met someone whom I consider masterful at my new hobby.
- I have a feeling that in the next few months something significant will happen in the gold markets.
- I don’t think William is going to stick around in his job much longer.
