I am …

- looking forward to the coming of springtime
- the end of this pandemic, and
- whatever fortune may bring tomorrow.

… grateful for

- the wisdom that comes from my marriage,
- my wife, and
- our work together.

… focused on

- the very next thing to be done for each goal before me.

… dreaming of

- meeting new people and
- getting to know my new home as pandemic restrictions are retired.

… reading

- Fortuna by Kristyn Merbeth
- Caliban‘s War by James S. A. Corey

… watching

- The Man in the High Tower
- American Gods
- The Stand
- Survivor season 13, to be followed by season 40
- waiting for the next season of The Expanse
