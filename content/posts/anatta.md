I may have groked what the Buddhist calls not-self, anattā.

I have had some part of my attention upon consciousness and time over the last few months. Not the surface definitions, not even the philosophical/physical conversation about the concepts. Instead, I have been attempting to grok the experience of consciousness and time.

That contemplation was my path to not-self. Compelling—if you happen to be "a set of causally interrelated psychophysical processes and events" collocated in space and time with my body and mind.

Now to determine if language can offer a way to talk about these. Time and Self are primary features of our communication.
