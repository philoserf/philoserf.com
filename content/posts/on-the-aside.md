Aside: A comment or discussion that does not relate directly to the main subject being discussed; A digression.

In an aside you can expect a more frequent, less intentional, much shorter, unedited, and perhaps, ill considered post. It may be apropos of nothing. It might be a link, with or without commentary, to some other tidbit of knowledge or amusement.
