When it comes to the social web I have played with many alternatives over the years, including some paid offerings, because I didn&#8217;t want to be the product being sold. The problem with all of them, so far, is adoption. The people I want to follow are on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and LinkedIn. I no longer wish to be on those platforms. So I am not active on them. I have also cut some other attention streams like Hacker News, Reddit, and the like.

I am enjoying having a few less continuous attention streams pulling on my monkey brain. Giving up Twitter, Facebook, and the others has been stress-reducing.
