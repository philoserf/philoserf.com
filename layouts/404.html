  <h2>Page Not Found</h2>
  <p>
    We lost the page you were seeking. There has been a mistake. I am certain it
    is not your mistake. Most content gets listed in the
    <a href="/topics/">Index</a>. Give that a try.

  <p>
    You can always go <a href="/">Home</a>. "There is no place like home," they
    say.
  </p>
  <p>
    And, finally, Google may have
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A{{ .Site.BaseURL }}"
      >indexed</a
    >
    the sought after page. Whatever you decide to do next—please—have a great
    day doing it.
