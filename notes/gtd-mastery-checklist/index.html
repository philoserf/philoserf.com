Natural Planning Model by heart (p. 56), and use it for personal project planning and for facilitating meetings.</li><li>I know the Threefold Model for Evaluating Daily Work by heart (p. 196), and

Anything, and several other books on personal productivity.</li><li>I get into a flow state when working about 1/4 to 1/2 of the time now.</li><li>I don’t ever carry anything in my head that could be put into my system, and many times during the day I download ideas, next actions, and projects to my lists.</li><li>I have read Getting Things Done at least twice, and used it so much for reference it is dog-eared and has notes on almost every page.</li><li>I always return phone calls within 24 hours, usually within 2-12 hours, with none lost or forgotten.</li><li>I respond to all emails within 24 hours (usually much sooner), and none get lost or forgotten.</li><li>When I put something into my inbox, I completely trust that it will get done…or I know why it’s not getting done and am comfortable with it.</li><li>When I commit to doing something for someone, I completely trust that I will do it…or I’ll let them know ahead of time why I can’t complete it.</li><li>That low-level anxiety I used

remember the last time something “fell through the cracks” in my system.</li><li>I get frustrated with people who drop the ball on things, because I honestly can’t understand their perspective

my altitudes.</li><li>I am so productive and clear that new creative ideas are bursting forth like never before…and I have a way to capture them and make them real, if I choose to.</li><li>I can always say no with integrity, because I always know what’s on my plate and what’s important.</li></ol><h3 id=mastery>Mastery</h3><ol><li>I have been using the GTD system for 12 months or more, very consistently.</li><li>My system has been squeaky clean for over 6 months.</li><li>My system has gone through several evolutions, changing tools as needed to improve productivity, adapting to my life appropriately.</li><li>I have coached over 10 people in successfully implementing GTD into their lives, who have sustained their systems for over 6 months.</li><li>I easily arrive at all appointments 10 minutes early, well-prepared, with a calm and peaceful mind.</li><li>I am usually in a flow state when working.</li><li>I never drink caffeine or eat sugar anymore–my work naturally energizes me.</li><li>I don’t work with people who let things drop through the cracks anymore, unless I absolutely have to, or unless they are my GTD coaching client.</li><li>I am known for consistently under-promising and over-delivering on my commitments to others.</li><li>I exercise regularly according to an intelligent plan that is best for my body and is leading towards ever-improving health, strength, aerobic capacity, flexibility, and overall fitness.</li><li>I get up at the same time early every morning, right when my alarm goes off, and immediately enter the GTD flow, with relaxed focus.</li><li>I have a regular spiritual practice, scheduled daily or weekly, which I consistently follow.</li><li>I have a list of books for personal/spiritual/career development which I consistently burn through, perhaps by scheduling reading time at regular times of the day or week.</li><li>I regularly try out new productivity tools, but only when there is a real need, not for the sake of “productivity pr0n.”</li><li>When I commit to something, it’s as good as done, no matter how hard or how many steps it will take.</li><li>Project planning and mind mapping are as easy and automatic as breathing to me.</li><li>I’ve delegated or automatized many of my regular errands, to the point where I rarely do errands anymore.</li><li>I’m surrounded by people who are as productive as me.</li><li>I have several mentors who are orders of magnitude more productive than me, whom I meet with regularly.</li><li>My living space is like a zen temple–everything accounted for, everything purposefully and consciously attended to.</li><li>My office space is meditatively state-changing–people regularly comment on how peaceful they feel when they sit at my desk.</li><li>I could, if I chose to, make a comfortable living teaching personal productivity–I have people asking me about it constantly, without me saying anything first.</li><li>I could write my own book on productivity…or maybe I already have.</li><li>I tend to reach my goals earlier and with greater ease than expected.</li><li>Work–and life–is ecstasy, bliss, pure joy.</li></ol><footer><p>&larr;
